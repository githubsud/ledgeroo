== Welcome to Ledgeroo

Ledgeroo is really a ledger but the name was already taken at the github. At the
moment it is a rails based ledger that will keep everything nice and balanced.
Batch functionality is also present for companies that still write checks the
old fashioned way.  I bet there are still some typewriters out there clicking
away...

In the future, ledgeroo should become more web services like so that it could 
be very easily integrated into existing systems.
