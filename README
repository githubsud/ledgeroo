== Welcome to Ledgeroo

Ledgeroo is simply a rails based ledger designed to be very flexible. At the
moment it provides views for checks and journal entries and will keep everything
nice and balanced. Batch functionality is also present for companies that still
write checks the old fashioned way.  I bet there are still some typewriters out
there clicking away...

In the future, ledgeroo should become more web services like so that it could 
be very easily integrated into existing systems, but in the meantime we'll 
be working on balancing accounts and adding support for defined accounting
periods and all the associated rules.
